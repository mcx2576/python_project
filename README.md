This folder includes some python projects.
1. The SATdoku project
In the Satdoku project, we are required to treat the sudoku as the SAT problem and apply some algorithms to solve it.
- We need to set up our own game rules for solving the sudoku.
- We have to make different assumptions regarding conditions that could influence the computer's speed to solve this problem.
- 50000 sudokus with 17 filled numbers were used to train the sudoku model.
2. Trec racing project
For this project, we have to apply algoirthms from computational intelligence field to code the controllers of a car.
- We coded the basic controller using multi-layer perceptrons
- Evalutionary algoirthms, specificaly, we applied the Neat package in python to controll the movements of the small car.
- In the end, we went deeper into the swarm intelligence and encode some strategies to make sure that two cars could collaborate with each other for driving.
