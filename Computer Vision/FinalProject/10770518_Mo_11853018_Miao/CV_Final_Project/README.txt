The project consists of part1 and part2.

For part1:
 - Extract the files in part1.zip (to i.e. folder "part1").
 - To run the files/view HTML files correctly, the folder "Caltech4" needs to be put inside the folder "part1".

For part2:
 - Extract the files in part2.zip (to i.e. folder "part2").
 - To run the files, the folder "Caltech4" needs to be at the same level (NOT inside) as the folder "part2".
 - For finetune_cnn.m to run, the map "matconvnet-1.0-beta23" should be set inside the folder "part2".
   (If it is positioned at some other location, the only change needed is to change the path location in the file at line 9.
